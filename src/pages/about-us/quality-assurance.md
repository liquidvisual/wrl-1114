Wilckens Roche is Williamstown's only legal practice certified to the international standard ISO 9001:2000 and LAW 9000 for the design, development, production and servicing of its products and services.  LAW 9000 was launched in June 2004 after being developed through a partnership of QL Inc and SAI Global, with the NSW Law Society and the College of Law.

The certification follows an audit of the management systems by SAI Global and sees Wilckens Roche join the very few legal practices in Australia to achieve such standing.

LAW 9000 - Legal Best Practice is a standard which uses the internationally recognised ISO 9001 as its foundation and contains best-practice criteria specific to a legal practice.  LAW 9000 doesn't just focus on service delivery, it's an holistic business assessment approach covering activities associated with business performance improvement as well as the engagement of clients through to the conclusion of matters.
