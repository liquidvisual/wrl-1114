## Our History

As the oldest law firm in Williamstown, Wilckens Roche Lawyers has served generations of families in the western suburbs of Melbourne.  Its founders were well-respected, resourceful lawyers who quickly made a name for the practice.  The founding partner was Nanna Frances Wilckens who graduated from the University of Melbourne with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1931 and a Bachelor of Laws degree in 1933.  The thirteenth woman admitted as a barrister and solicitor in Victoria, Nanna Wilckens first established the practice in East Melbourne and Bairnsdale in the 1930s.

Nanna Wilckens was joined in practice by Alice Mary Roche, who also graduated from the University of Melbourne, with a Master of Arts degree in 1935 and later, with a Bachelor of Laws degree in 1951.  Alice Roche was admitted as a barrister and solicitor upon the motion of Mr E H Hudson QC on 3 March 1952.

Wilckens Roche has had its offices in Williamstown since 1951.  During more than half a century of service to residents of the Western suburbs, Wilckens Roche has developed a reputation for client focus, attention to detail and delivering results.

The traditions of our past are melded with the latest technology and resources, to deliver quality services to our clients.  Wilckens Roche is large enough to provide expert advice in a number of practice areas, yet small enough to maintain a personal relationship with all of its clients.  Clients return to Wilckens Roche because we take the time to understand their needs and are committed to responding to them in a timely manner.  Some of our staff have been with Wilckens Roche for more than 40 years!

## Our Culture

At Wilckens Roche we have a culture of caring for both our clients and each other.  We enjoy working in an environment that is welcoming, supportive and open.  We believe that this is reflected in how we deal with our clients.  We understand that a legal matter isn't just about the law, contract clauses or the 'day in court' - it's about helping real people overcome obstacles, reach goals and improve their lives.
